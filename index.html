        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Kimberly Juarez. I am currently majoring in Education at UC Riverside. I am a junior, and currently employed at Office Depot where I have been working for one year and ten months. My goal is to become a teacher for an elementary school or even middle school. Since I was young I have always dreamed of becoming a teacher, it is a passion. Eventually, I see myself as a principal or a counselor in administration. I just want to make an impact in students' lives just as the teachers I have done in my life. I want to motivate and encourage students to continue their education become successful and love what they are doing for their career. Although I am a full-time student I am also working as a part-time sales advisor at my local office supply store, Office Depot. So far I have enjoyed working here because it has taught me the value of social interaction. I have learned many skills during my time as a sales associate at Office Depot. For example, I have learned how to communicate more effectively with customers and my coworkers. I have improved my time management, and I have also learned many skills involving the POS system, as well as working with Microsoft Office and other sources that play an important role in my work environment. At my current job, I do the following. I am the cashier. I make sure everyone is satisfied on the sales floor. I am the one to go to ask if customers need any help finding something or need me to place an order for an item that is out of stock. Additionally, here and then I am placed in the print department where I assist customers in printing documents, faxing, and scanning documents to their email or USB, as well as printing large prints like posters, blueprints, etc. Any print job you can think of we do at Office Depot. My favorite part of working in the print department would be laminating. It is so fun for me, as well as creating posters for events and mounting them on poster boards. I am familiar with Canvas design, Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. Before working at Office Depot, I was working at Subway as a sandwich artist. There I essentially made the sandwiches for customers and rang them up. Working there was fun though it was a handful because the customers there were somewhat rude as well as my manager. I did not like how the manager communicated I felt as if she was disrespectful and out of place. Thankfully I took a break and prepared myself for school. I waited until the first year of school to finish so I could find another job and I have managed to work and go to school at the same time. Office Depot has been very understanding with my school schedule and it is a great thing. I can say I am prepared for the future.</p><br><br>
